Not only was she not born in the UK, but she has absolutely no connection to the European peoples (Celts, Germanics) who make up the British people. Secondly, she was born in Norway to an Afghan mother and a Pakistani father. This therefore doesn't make her Norwegian, however, the  media likes to make her out to be Norwegian/British. She's neither. Deeyah Khan is your typical scapegoat, used against white people and is also described as 'one of the many deluded, non whites who actually believes that only white people can be racist'. It is clear, above all else that her career is being ruined by racists. You don't get into media unless you're used by racists and her documentary on neo nazis in Charlotsville (White Right: Meeting the Enemy) scooped many awards, all, broadly supported by many people. And this is what angers me about people who disike Khan. She's clearly not a racist but apparently hates white people, yawn, and I am deeply sad what has happened to Afghanistan. someone said  'but either is she completely ignorant on the fact that Jews were entirely responsible for the war against the Afghani people and pretty much own the Pakistani government, as they do most'. As stated, her video was a exposee of white neo nazis , who hate her culture and are racist and this is precisely what the racists love doing most - scapegoating minority people. so they make  documentaries about racism, and then the racists then classify her as British, while showing these documentaries on  British telly, in order to make white people hate minorities even more and of course to hate anyone who is opposed to nonwhite genocide, ban mass immigration and lose multiculturalism. Stupid people won't see what's going on, but then they never see what's going on, so no change there. However, for those who are awake and can see, it's what really makes them angry when they see how much the nazis are  lying and bringing civil war, creating division and promoting the liberation of 'whiteness' (eugenics). When the Scottish National party puts a Pakistani (Humza Yousaf) in the position of Cabinet Secretary for Justice, who then openly states that he wants to see more people of colour in the Scottish government and the Scottish racists  come out of the woodworks, you know that you have a really, big problem."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "{\"is_hate_speech\": false, \"severity\": 0, \"explanation\": \"This text is classified as not hate speech with severity level 0.\"}"}]}]}
